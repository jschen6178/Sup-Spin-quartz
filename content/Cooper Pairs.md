### Cooper Pairs
- **Definition**: Electrons can couple with each other at ranges of hundreds of nanometers, orders of magnitude larger than lattice spacing. The effective net attraction between the normally repulsive electrons produces a **pair binding energy** on the order of milli-electron volts, enough to keep them paired at **extremely low temperatures**.
