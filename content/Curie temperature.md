The temperature above which certain materials lose their permanent magnetic properties, which can (in most cases) be replaced by induced magnetism. 

Intuition: at higher temperatures, electrons have higher thermal energy leading to a randomizing effect on aligned magnetic domains and a disrupting of order.
