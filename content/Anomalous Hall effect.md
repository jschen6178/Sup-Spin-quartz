See [[Hall effect]] for classical hall effect.

### Anomalous Hall effect
- **Definition**: In ferromagnetic materials and paramagnetic materials in an external magnetic field, the Hall resistivity includes an additional contribution, known as the anomalous Hall effect, which depends directly on the magnetization of the material and can often be much larger than the ordinary Hall effect. 
  
- **Physical Origin**:
	- **Intrinsic**: [[Berry phase]] effect in the crystal momentum space (k-space)
	- **Extrinsic**: [[Spin-dependent scattering]] of charge carriers
