### Superconducting Dots
Superconducting dots are small, isolated regions of superconducting material, often on the nanometer scale. They exhibit quantum effects due to their small size, such as quantized energy levels and discrete superconducting states.

### Antidots
Superconducting antidots are essentially the opposite of superconducting dots. Instead of being isolated regions of superconducting material, antidots are holes or non-superconducting regions within a superconducting matrix. These holes can trap magnetic flux and influence the movement of vortices within the superconductor.
