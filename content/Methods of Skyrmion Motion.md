1. **Spin polarized current**:
   When an electrical current passes through a magnetic material, it becomes spin-polarized. This means the spins of the conduction electrons align in a particular direction due to the magnetic order of the material.

2. **[[Spin Transfer Torque]]**:
   The polarized spins of the conduction electrons interact with the localized magnetic moments of skyrmion. This interaction transfers angular momentum from the conduction electrons to the skyrmion, exerting a torque on the skyrmion's magnetic structure.

3. **Adiabatic and Non-adiabatic Torques**:
   - Adiabatic torque is proportional to the local spin polarization of the current and acts directly along the direction of electron flow
   - Non-adiabatic torque arises from misalignments and other imperfections and can act perpendicular to the adiabatic torque. It plays a significant role in driving the skyrmion motion.

4. **Magnus Force**:
   Skyrmions experience a Magnus force, analogous to the Lorentz force experienced by charged particles in a magnetic field. This force is due to the topological nature of skyrmions and causes them to move perpendicular to the direction of the applied current.

5. **[[Skyrmion Hall Effect]]**:
   Combined effect of STT and Magnus force leading to perpendicular motion of skyrmions relative to proper motion.
