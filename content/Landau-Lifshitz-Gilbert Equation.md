### LLG Equation
- **Definition**: Describes the dynamics of a magnetization vector $\textbf{M}$ in a magnetic material. It accounts for the precession of the magnetization around the effective magnetic field and a damping term that causes the magnetization to eventually align with the effective field.
- **Equation**:$$\frac{\partial\textbf{m}}{\partial t} = \boldsymbol{\tau} = \cfrac{\gamma}{1+\alpha^2}\left(\textbf{m}\times \textbf{B}_{\text{eff}} + \alpha \textbf{m} \times (\textbf{m} \times \textbf{B}_{\text{eff}})\right).$$where $\textbf{m}, \textbf{B}_{\text{eff}}$ are vector fields and $\textbf{m}$ is a unit vector. $\gamma$ is the [[Blundell#1.1.1 Magnetic moments and angular momentum|gyromagnetic ratio]] and $\alpha$ is the damping factor. This does not account for a possible current, that would add additional torque.
 
#### Damping Factor (Gilbert Damping)

1. **Intrinsic sources**:
	- **[[Spin-Orbit coupling]]**: In a ferromagnetic material, spins or electrons interact with their orbital motion. This interaction can lead to the transfer of angular momentum from the spin system to the lattice, causing damping. 
	- **[[Electron magnon interactions]]**: Magnons are quanta of spin waves in a magnetic material. Interactions between the spins and Magnons can lead to energy dissipation and contribute to Gilbert damping.
	- **[[Electron phonon interactions]]**: Phonons are quanta of lattice vibrations. The interaction between the magnetic moments and phonons can lead to the transfer of energy and angular momentum from the spin system to the lattice, resulting in damping.

2. **Extrinsic sources**:
	- **Defects and Impurities**: Defects in a material can cause electrons to scatter, increasing damping.
	- **Surface and interface effects**: In multi-layer thin film materials, surfaces and interfaces can contribute significantly to damping.
