### In-Plane Magnetism
- **Definition**: In-plane magnetism refers to magnetic that lie within the plane of the material.

- **Characteristics**:
	- The magnetic moments are aligned parallel to the plane.
	- Often observed in thin films or layered structures where the interaction within the plane is stronger than perpendicular to the plane. 
	- In-plane magnetic anisotropy can be influenced by factors such as strain, interface effects, and crystal structure (see [[Magneto-crystalline Anisotropy]])

- **Applications**:
	- Used in magnetic storage devices, sensors, and spintronic devices where control of the in-plane magnetic state is critical.

### Out-of-Plane Magnetism
- **Definition**: Out-of-plane magnetism refers to magnetic moments that are oriented perpendicular to the plane of the material.
- **Characteristics**:
	- The magnetic moments are aligned perpendicular to the plane.
	- Commonly seen in materials where perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) is strong.
	- PMA can be enhanced by factors such as interface effects, [[spin-orbit coupling]], and specific crystalline structures.
