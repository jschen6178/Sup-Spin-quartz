### Goals
- [x] Field sweep script
- [ ] AC resistance measurement using just the Stanford (Later)

### Summary
10:30 Currently magnet driver is not compatible with pymeasure since it uses GPIB?
Lunch-3:30 Playing around with magnet and trying to heat it up.
For every 0.5 K of heating, the magnet heats up by roughly 1.5K. So you need to get within 0.5 K of your set temperature with the knob, otherwise you cannot use the magnet?
4:30 Trying to get it to 12K
5:30 Working B SWEEP!

### Ideas
> For increasing sensitivity

Lock-in?
Series resistor?
