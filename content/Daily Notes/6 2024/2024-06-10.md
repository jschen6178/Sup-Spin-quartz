### Goals
- [ ] Petrovic Slides
- [x] Autolab / meet with Gunasheel
- [x] Cryo training updates with shaohai / Ganesh

### Summary
In at 9
10:00 Petrovic
10:30 AutoLab Setup
11:00 Lakeshore modules
Lunch
2:00 More Modules
3:30 Petrovic and Yongjie Xie

### Notes
**AutoLab**: code up temperature control, magnet power supply (changing field), measuring resistivity.

For drivers: Lakeshore temperature controller, and Lakeshore magnet power supply (?).

Electrical driver: Yokohama (insert model number), might need to write a driver for that. Stanford lock-in SR 350 (?) is pretty standard so should be able to find the driver.

Jifei and Tommy for AutoLab support.

python GUI builder

Jifei code:

- main file is an **experiment**, for example **FMR.py**.
	- import **drivers** such as **LS336**
	- import **utils**, for example loggers
	- has **default settings**
	- init saves **settings**, and **logger stuff**
	- device functions build the device classes and return them
	- **hysteresis sweep**
		- init logging
		- init devices
		- use settings to prepare the devices
