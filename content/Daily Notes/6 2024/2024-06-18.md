### Goals
- [x] Temperature control for cryo probe via python
- [x] Export stray field from mumax simulation
- [x] get the base model done for pytdgl

### Summary
10:00-11:00 Tested cryo probe controls, need to cool down further by removing radiation shield and then test. When heating make sure the magnet is not getting heated as well (base position). The cold head should be somewhere in between rad and base.
11:00-1:00 running stray field
2:30- figure out how to implement stray field into pytdgl (doesn't look possible atm)
4:00-6:00 set up square for pytdgl

temperature just set to high and blast the magnet
