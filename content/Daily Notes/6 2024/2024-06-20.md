### Goals
- [x] Solve for vector potential
- [x] Call Ganesh to get samples
- [x] Test Magnet and Yoko

### Summary
I forgot my badgeðŸ˜–.

10:30-12:00 Green's function and Coulomb gauge fixing to solve for A from B. $\nabla^2 A = -\nabla \times B$. 
12:30  Let's see if we can calculate the vector potential and assign it into a parameter in PyTDGL

`ConstantField` returns a Parameter that calls the `constant_field_vector_potential` function with some specific `Bz`. `constant_field_vector_potential` function utilizes the `uniform_Bz_vector_potential` function which takes `(positions, Bz)` and outputs `A = np.stack([Ax, Ay, np.zeros_like(Ax)], axis=1)`.
Dude what the fuck is this.

3:00 cryo lab ganesh call? Trying to see if there are any samples we can work with. Maybe fiddle with the microscope.
5:30 Finished testing stuff. Eventually settled for Keithley 2001 multimeter. Got everything working measured gold pad at 2 ohms. Tomorrow will work on scripting. This is priority.
