### Goals
- [ ] Script for cryo probe
	- [x] Temperature sweep at 0 field
	- [x] Field sweep at "constant" temperature
		- [ ] no script though
	- [x] Read from Keithley

### Summary
9:30 Temperature sweep testing. [PyMeasure Tutorial](https://github.com/pymeasure/pymeasure/blob/master/examples/Current-Voltage%20Measurements/iv_keithley.py)
12:00 Stuff works. Temperature sweeping is good, reading resistivity. Playing around with settings such as PID and power. Looks like depending on the range of your temperature sweep you might need to use more/less power. The larger the range of your sweep, the more power you need. 12-20K uses more power than 12-15K to push the sample to 20K.

Effect of nplc: slower reading (cannot do 0.1 s per measurement)
