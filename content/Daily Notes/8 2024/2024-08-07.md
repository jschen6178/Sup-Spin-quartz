### Goals
- [x] Lock-in
- [ ] Figure out how to autorange the lock-in on pymeasure
- [ ] Compare resistance values from lock-in and nanovoltmeter
### Notes
Nanovoltmeter has bad connection

Sending in **0.100V** from the lock-in through the pre-amplifier set at $10^{-3}$ amps per volt and small knob at x$10$ results in a **260** $\mu A$ current. 

We setup the lock in and combined the AC DC current. However, when they are combined via the summation amplifier, the DC current heats the sample up a lot. We need to check how much it is amplifying the current by.

Another issue is that the Tc of the sample appears to be getting lower. Sample 3169 (?) used to be at 9.5 K but now it is at 8.3 K ish. Just to double check, we removed the AC component and performed a temperature sweep. Results were the same - 8.3 K.
