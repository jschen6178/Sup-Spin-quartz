### Summary
11:00 clock in
Example03 and 04 are useful for inserting skyrmions
Maybe play around with them first to see what determines the size.
1:30 Not sure why the skyrmion isn't showing up?
Also, not sure if I'm exporting the right layer in mumax into pytdgl. 

Playing around with just DMI:

Low DMI reduces the size of the skyrmion, making it too high (6->8) causes instability and stripes. 
Increasing Aex seems to stabilize a higher DMI but doesn't seem to make it that much larger
Reducing anisotropy definitely makes the skyrmion bigger (why?)
Reducing anisotropy needs some stability. Trying to bump up field from 75 mT to 125 mT.
Bumping up field made skyrmions smaller.
Half anisotropy is stable at 125 mT but not 75 mT
Quarter anisotropy with Aex adjusted from 12e-12 to 16e-12 gave a good big boy.

3:00 Export this ovf to numpy and see what happens

Note - when manipulating anisotropy with Msat, it severely decreases the magnitude of the demag B field. Maybe we can keep Msat the same but use a different constant to manipulate KU_1.

Some observations:  

1. Vortices do seem to be more centrally clustered, could be due to the large skyrmion.
2. Skyrmion field is much weaker. Plotted on the right is the total field, which includes an external 0.125 T field. Hence, the field produced by the skyrmion is quite weak compared to the applied external field. This is in contrast to previous simulations, where the field of the skyrmions were similar in magnitude if not stronger to the external field. Right now the skyrmion field is weaker because I had to decrease the saturation magnetization to create a larger skyrmion (since anisotropy was dependent on Msat).
3. Something to adjust is to leave Msat as normal and tweak anisotropy itself to create a larger skyrmion that has an equally strong field.

Increasing Keff makes the skyrmion disappear, need a stronger DMI.
Stronger DMI leads to stripes, have a stronger exchange.
Once more, not a strong effect on size by exchange.

Increased DMI and Aex by roughly a factor of 8, changed Keff from 0 to 2e5. Keff added stability.
