### Goals
- [x] IV sweeping
- [x] outline from m of skyrmion
	- [ ] retrieve size from that somehow
- [ ] figure out a consistent method to vary size without changing the saturation and the applied field

### Summary
11:00 IV sweep went well, just have an unusual artifact. 
Papers:
Wu et. al 2021
It is known that the size of isolated skyrmions increases with the Dzyaloshinskiiâ€“Moriya interaction (DMI) strength, and decreases with the exchange stiffness coefficient and magnetic anisotropy.

what to do about modelling
1. Make parameters more realistic (see papers sent by Gunasheel).
2. Can try exploring with bloch instead of neel skyrmions
3. Talk to tommy/jifei about manipulating size while preserving field strength
4. How can we make the field strength strong enough to produce vortices? Firstly, we need the applied field to be below the critical field of the superconductor.

Got the outline overlay working!

Next is to get a single skyrmion that has a field strong enough to create a vortex, and then also get it's outline. **skyrmion_size.mx3**


Also send a current.
