### Goals
- [ ] Figure out a reasonable coherence length

### Summary
Mumax3 Procedure:

Run at 750K for 1e-9 Seconds.
Relax down to 10K for 1e-9 Seconds.

Move to next step at 750K and repeat.


Note: Maybe increasing distance away from the magnetic layer can make the skyrmion "appear" bigger and increase coupling, even though the field might be weaker.

Higher coherence length means more likely to create vortices?
