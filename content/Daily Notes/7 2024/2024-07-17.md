### Goals
- [x] Wrap up tdgl results
	- [x] Run the last few models with 7Stack

### Summary
11:00 Learned about [[Superconductor Properties]]
12:45 Post processed 75-150mT 7Stack runs
1:00 First run of 75 with xi 13 and 39/25 penetration depth/$d_s$

Theory says $$M_s \geq \frac{\Phi_0 \ln\left(\frac{\Lambda}{\xi}\right)}{0.86\pi^2 d_m r_{\text{sk}}}$$where $\Lambda$ is the pearl depth, $\xi$ is the coherence length, $d_m$ is the thickness of the magnetic layer, and $r_{\text{sk}}$ is the radius of the skyrmion.

Something to note is that skyrmion size will be affected by the presence of a vortex, which makes sense since the screening current of a vortex will counter act the applied field needed to stabilize a skyrmion, likely making the skyrmion size bigger.

4:40 Penetration depth has no effect. Is it because we are in 2D?
