### Goals
- [x] Just do xi = 13 and with applied field for everything
- [ ] Then we can play around with the coherence length and penetration depth? And then tune down field to 0
### Summary

Fe 6_2
25 mT run -- xi 13 and 20 look the same, applied field removed does not help even though skyrmion negative field becomes stronger. 

50 mT -- xi 13 has no significant vortices

75 mT -- xi 13 no significant vortices

Fe 4_4
50 and 70 mT no vortices
100 mT the vortices from the applied field show up but the skyrmions do not interact to product antivortices
125mT same, skyrmions are not big enough to create anti vortices or not enough flux?


Another thing to test from petrovich - the inequality that coherence length must be less than the radius of a skyrmion which must be less than the pearl depth for SVP to form.

Another thing to test is maybe add more layers in mumax to take the field further away to create larger domains?

Petrovic is going beyond H critical anyways?

Apply a current and see if this can happen
