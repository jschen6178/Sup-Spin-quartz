### Goals
- [ ] Ganesh data
- [ ] Simulate single skyrmion in 14 layer stack and compare against Logan source
- [ ] Simulate a lattice

### Summary
10:30 clock in
1:30 RWB plots are done, but it's hard to see the pairs. Data is very noisy, wonder if there's some post processing I can do.
2:00 Thinking of iterating through different coherence lengths to see how they affect SVP
