### Goals
- [ ] Presentation outline done
### Summary
We messed up the stack number oops. Stronger field with more stacks. 

In reality we have 7 nm in between the stack and the Nb. TaN, Pt, Ir 8nm of heavy metal before the first ferromagnetic layer.

We can also increase the depth of the superconductor

Effective coherence length due to Pt coupling increases xi up to 36 nm.

Morning:
Rerunning mumax with high stacks, also rerunning tdgl FeCo5_5 with higher coherence
