### Goals
- [ ] Import the small field skyrmions into tdgl
- [ ] do some more measurements
- [ ] write a script in mumax to do that field sweep thingy
### Summary
12:00 R vs. T for sample 3 #3165                                                                 
1:30 R vs. B is so weird...
Talked to Ganesh and Gunasheel. Maybe I should just skip this for now.
Might need to decrease the applied current to reduce heating in the sample

3:00 We can control whether we want a lattice or isolated skyrmion population via the ratio of Fe to Co in our sample. We can also increase DMI to between 1.6 and 2.2.

Simulations for Fe/Co 2/6 are a lot smaller than what Anjan paper is saying (75 nm???)
