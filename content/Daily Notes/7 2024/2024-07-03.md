### Goals
Continue from yesterday simulations for tdgl.
- [x] make the skyrmion swol
	- [x] run tdgl
	- [ ] don't weaken the field dummy
- [ ] 1skyr, 2skyr, Red skyr, Blue skyr
- [ ] Hysteresis
- [ ] https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021999116302650 figure out what's happening here

- [ ] Email Hazami

Side goal: more complete understanding of skyrmion-vortex interactions.
- [ ] read that paper you just downloaded [[Andriyakhina and Burmistrov 2021]]


### Summary
9:30 clockin
Browse some russian history
1:00pm consider some 3D work, stay with 2D for now.
3:00 stray field v4 mumax tdgl results![[Pasted image 20240703145953.png]]
Running with just 125mT to see if the skyrmion has any real effect on the simulation. Might be a cache issue. 
Just 125 mT:

75mT circular run has no effect, field is not strong enough to cause skyrmions?
