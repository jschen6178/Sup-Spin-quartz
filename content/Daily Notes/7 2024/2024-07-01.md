### Goals
- [x] Effect of realigning field to a corner vs. the center (does it break symmetry)?
- [x] Effect of adding the x and y components using a similar r x B procedure
	- [x] run separately Bx By Bz (Bz already done)
	- [x] then add together to get the final Axyz
- [ ] Effect of recalculating A via the magnetization and not the demag field
- [x] Replacing samples in cryo

### Summary
9:30 Settle down (and forget your work pass)
10:00 explaining pymeasure to Ashley
11:00 Lunch
12:00 Replace samples and cool down instrument
2:00 Modelling
5:30 B_y

Note: Solved the asymmetry, was multiplying by the wrong x,y values at the end. (y, -y) when it should have been (y, -x) times stuff. 

Useful command [tdgl.Solution.from_hdf5()](https://py-tdgl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/solution.html#tdgl.Solution.from_hdf5) to load saved solutions. 

Note: Cannot do anything 3D ðŸ˜¦
### Next-next steps
1. Monitor just one skyrmion at a time. Vary it's size. Line image gaussian something.
2. Vary the number from 1-2-3 etc.
3. Hysteresis? Calculate average |Psi|, number of vortices, average phase (ideally 0) as a function of a magnetic field. Will tell you if the superconductor has any hysteretic behavior.
