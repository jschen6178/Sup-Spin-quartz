### Goals
- [ ] Iterate through different parameters in mumax for tdgl experiments
- [ ] run tdgl on just external field to see how it performs without the FM textures
### Summary
11:00 Still working on 2/6 Fe/Co
Tried 20 layers, upped the interlayer exchange.
Back to 2 layers, making the board size bigger since skyrmions are apparently enormous?
Not sure how to keep skyrmions stable both with low-temperature and low-field. Seems impossible. Not sure how Xie does it?

Parameters:
$A_{\text{ex}} = 12e{-12}$
$D_{\text{ind}} = 1.8e{-3}$
$M_{\text{sat}} = 1e6$

Goal - get your skyrmions bigger to radius of 95 nm at 10K
Shoot, how did I get the lattice again?

4:00 exported some weird ku = 1-3e5
5:00 maybe make small and large scale simulations


|                    | $K_{\text{eff}} = 2e5$ | $1e5$ | $0e5$ |

| $5\text{mT}$       |                        |       |       |
|                    |                        |       |       |

Might need to alter penetration depth and coherence length to get vortices to appear with such small skyrmion vortices. This is why it's important to increase critical temperature so that we can also increase skyrmion size at the same time? Also lower field creates larger skyrmions. This is good because then we don't have to worry about the critical field.
