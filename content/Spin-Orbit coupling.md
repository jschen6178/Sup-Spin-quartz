> Spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is a quantum mechanical phenomenon where the intrinsic spin of an electron interacts with its orbital motion around the nucleus. This interaction is crucial in understanding various properties of materials, particularly in the context of magnetism, electronic structure, and spintronics.
### Key concepts of Spin-Orbit Coupling
1. **Intrinsic Spin**: An intrinsic form of angular momentum carried by electrons, independent of their motion through space. 
2. **Orbital Motion**: The movement of electrons around the nucleus, which creates an effective magnetic field experienced by the electron due to its charge. 
3. **Spin-Orbit Interaction**: The coupling between the electron's spin and its orbital motion, leading to shifts in energy levels and modifications of magnetic properties.
