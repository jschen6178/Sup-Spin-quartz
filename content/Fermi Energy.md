### Basic Concepts
- **Fermi energy** ($E_F$): The Fermi energy is the highest energy level occupied by electrons in a material at absolute zero temperature.
- **Fermi surface**: In a momentum space (or k-space), the Fermi surface is a surface that separates occupied from unoccupied electron states at $E_F$. 

### Intuitive Understanding
1. **Electrons in a Metal**: In a metal, electrons fill up available energy states up to the Fermi energy, according to the Pauli exclusion principle. These electrons are often referred to as a "Fermi sea."
2. **Electrons near the Fermi surface**: These are electrons whose energy levels are close to the Fermi energy. They have a significant role in determining physical properties and phenomena of the metal, including electrical conduction, heat capacity, and interactions leading to superconductivity.
