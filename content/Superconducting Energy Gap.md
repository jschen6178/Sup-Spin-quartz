### Definition
The superconducting energy gap, often denoted as $\Delta$, is the minimum energy required to break a Cooper pair and create two quasiparticle excitations in a superconductor. It represents the binding energy of the Cooper pairs.

### Physical Intuition
- Electrons near the Fermi level form cooper pairs under the superconducting state
- These pairs create an energy gap in the spectrum of the material
- No single-particle electronic states exist in this gap (they are either excited or remain in the ground state)

### BCS Theory
-  The energy gap at zero temperature is given by $$\Delta = 1.764k_BT_c$$ where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant and $T_c$ is the critical temperature.
- The energy gap follows a temperature dependent relationship given by $$\Delta(T) = \Delta(0)\sqrt{1-\frac{T}{T_c}}.$$
