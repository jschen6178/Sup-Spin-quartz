# Interaction of a Neel–type skyrmion and a superconducting vortex

### Abstract 
>Superconductor–ferromagnet heterostructures hosting vortices and skyrmions are new area of an interplay between superconductivity and magnetism. We study an interaction of a Neel–type skyrmion and a Pearl vortex in thin heterostructures due to stray fields. Surprisingly, we find that it can be energetically favorable for the Pearl vortex to be situated at some nonzero distance from the center of the Neel–type skyrmion. The presence of a vortex–antivortex pair is found to result in increase of the skyrmion radius. Our theory predicts that a spontaneous generation of a vortex–anti-vortex pair is possible under some conditions in the presence of a Neel–type skyrmion.

### Background
- It has been shown that the presence of skyrmions affects strongly Josephson current via S-FM-S Josephson junctions.
- Skyrmion configurations can be stabilized by a [[superconducting dot]] or antidot situated at the top of a ferromagnetic film. 
- In ferromagnet-superconductor heterostructures superconducting vortices and skyrmions can form bound pairs either due to interplay of proximity effect and spin-orbit coupling or due to their interaction via stray fields.
