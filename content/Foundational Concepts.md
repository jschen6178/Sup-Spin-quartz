Interactions such as [[Exchange Interaction]], [[DMI]], magneto-static, anisotropy; ordering temperature such as [[Curie temperature]] and [[Neel temperature]] 

Typical [[In-Plane versus Out-of-Plane Magnetism|in-plane and out-of-plane]] magnets and their behavior 

Some electrical transport effects like [[Anomalous Hall effect]], [[Spin Hall effect]], Anisotropic magnetoresistance. 

Experiments: Magnetometry, longitudinal resistance and transverse resistance measurements, scanning probe microscopy 

General superconductivity: 

[[Critical temperature]], critical field, critical current, Meissner effect

Length scales mainly [[Coherence Length|coherence length]] and [[Penetration Depth|penetration depth]]

Techniques and terminology such as: Resistance measurements, spectroscopy and Josephson junction measurements.
