### Order parameter
- **Definition**: Describes how ordered a phase is. Can be a scalar, vector, or even a tensor.
- **Example**: Magnetic dipoles. $\phi$ is the magnetization which is the magnetic moment per unit volume.

### Superconducting Order Parameter
- **Definition**: Denoted as $\Psi(\textbf{r})$, and expressed as $$\Psi(\textbf{r}) = |\Psi(\textbf{r})|e^{i\phi(\textbf{r})}$$ where $|\Psi(\textbf{r})|$ is the magnitude of the order parameter, representing the local density or [[Cooper Pairs]] and $\phi(\textbf{r})$ is the phase of the order parameter, representing the phase coherence of the superconducting wave function.
- **Phase coherence**: Intuitively, on a macroscopic scale like superconductors and superfluids, phase coherence implies that a large number of particles such as Cooper pairs share a common phase, leading to collective behavior.
- **Vanishing of the order parameter**: In type-II superconductors, magnetic vortices can penetrate the material. At the core of a vortex, the magnitude of the order parameter $|\Psi|$ goes to zero, and the phase $\phi$ winds around the core, leading to a quantized magnetic flux through the vortex. The total phase change around a vortex is $2\pi$.
